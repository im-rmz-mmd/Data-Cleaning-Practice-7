ðŸ“Š First Data Analysis Experience with SQLite and Seaborn

After learning new concepts for a while, I decided to take on a test project, and the result was an exciting data analysis on an SQLite database!

ðŸ˜Ž But this time, there was a major difference:
âœ… Instead of CSV files, I used SQLite for data storage.
âœ… Along with Matplotlib, I leveraged Seaborn for better data visualization.

Letâ€™s dive into the process! ðŸš€


ðŸ›  Step 1: Data Loading and Cleaning

The first step was to connect to the SQLite database and clean up the data.

ðŸ“Œ Connecting to the Database and Reading Data
Using sqlite3 and pandas, I connected to the database and loaded the data.
This method is far more efficient than CSV files in terms of speed and data management.

ðŸ“Œ Removing Unnecessary and Incomplete Data

Dropped redundant columns (such as employee numbers and commission data).

Removed duplicate and missing records.

Clean data ensures more accurate analysis!


ðŸ“Œ Renaming Columns
To improve readability, I renamed some columns. For instance:

ENAME â†’ Name

HIREDATE â†’ Hire_Date


ðŸ“Š Step 2: Data Analysis and Visualization

Once the data was cleaned, I extracted meaningful insights from it!

ðŸ”¹ Average Salary by Job Title

One key question was: Which job titles have the highest salaries?

Grouped salaries by job title and calculated the average.

Used Seabornâ€™s barplot to visualize the results.


ðŸ“Œ Seaborn provides better aesthetics and color schemes than Matplotlib, making visualizations more engaging!

ðŸ”¹ Salary Trends Based on Hire Date ðŸ“…

I wanted to analyze whether salaries changed over time.

Converted hire dates to DateTime format and sorted them chronologically.

Used a line plot to track salary changes over time.


ðŸ”¹ Salary Distribution Across Job Titles ðŸ’°

To see salary variations within each job title, I used a box plot.

This visualization highlights minimum, maximum, and average salaries per job.

It also reveals if there's a significant salary gap within a specific job role.

This was my first hands-on experience with SQLite and Seaborn for data analysis.
Next, I plan to explore more advanced statistical techniques and improve my data storytelling skills.
